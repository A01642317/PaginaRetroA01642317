            <p class="intro">The <b>Nintendo 64</b> was first launched worldwide in 1996. With a classic catalogue of amazing titles, the console managed to captivate millions of gaming
                enthusiasts, such as myself. The purpose of this website is to provide a comprehensive list of all my favorite games on the console, ordered by my personal preference.
                I will also include a brief description of each game along with why I love it.

                    <p class="article_text">The definition of a classic. Many regard Ocarina of Time as the Citizen Kane of videogames: 
                        a foundational text upon which the rest of gaming has been built. The influence this game had on the industry can't be overstated. 
                        Apart from this, however, OOT is a great game. It's able to capture a sense of adventure and the feeling of growing up in one package, in a way that
                        can give people of different ages different emotional experiences.

                    <p class="article_text">Super Mario 64 represents one of the highest peaks of game design on three vectors: adapting a 2D game into 3D,
                        showcasing new hardware through software, and the genre of 3D platformers in general. This game is astonishing mainly through its innovation:
                        it managed to redefine what videogames could look and play like. Through tight controls, impressive level design, and amazing music, this game is a must-play
                        for anyone looking to reconnect with the classics.

                    <p class="article_text">Paper Mario manages to pack a challenging, well-written, and intriguing adventure into a single cartridge. The story is charming, the 
                        gameplay is extremely intuitive and fun, and the character design is superb. The main thing I love about this game is how it manages to always keep going,
                        never stopping to rest on its all gas and no breaks adventure. This game might not be the first thing you think of when thinking about the N64,
                        but that sounds like a <i>you</i> problem.

                    <p class="article_text">How does one follow up Ocarina of Time? This question was clearly never even a problem over at nintendo, since they managed
                        to create a worthy sequel in less than two years! Majora's Mask is truly an extraordinary exploration of death and loss, a poetic continuation of
                        their forray into the concept growing older. This game gave me nightmares as a kid and made me cry as an adult. What else is there to say?

                    <p class="article_text">F-ZERO X is the best racing game on the N64. It's smooth gameplay, polished controls, and tough difficulty curve make it a complete
                        package. F-ZERO X makes players really have to understand every mechanic and interaction thoroughly before delving deeper into its difficulty levels,
                        and rewards patience and understanding. I like this game because of how powerful it makes you feel when you understand. It is truly one of the best
                        examples of leveling up through practice instead of experience points.
